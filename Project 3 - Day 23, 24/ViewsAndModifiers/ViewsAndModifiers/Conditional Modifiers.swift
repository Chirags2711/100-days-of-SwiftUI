        .foregroundStyle(useRedtext ? .red: .blue)
        //You can often use regular if conditions to return different views based on some state, but this actually creates more work for SwiftUI â€“ rather than seeing one Button being used with different colors, it now sees two different Button views, and when we flip the Boolean condition it will destroy one to create the other rather than just recolor what it has.
